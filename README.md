A simple banking interface using Java. This java code contains basic functions like :-
<li>Deposit money</li>
<li>Withdraw money</li>
<li>Check balance</li>
<li>Take a loan</li>
<li>Repay that loan</li>
It is password protected and user gets a maximum of 5 attempts at the password (<b>Deb2025</b> in this case)

As of now, this is just for a single user, more changes coming to it soon with multiple users using databases
